    "Hacker News is a popular news website where people can upload posts and comment about various topics related to the tech field. We will be focusing on two types of posts made on Hacker News: Ask HN and Show HN posts. Ask HN posts are posts that are made for the purpose of asking a question to the community. Show HN posts are posts that are meant to showcase a particular project, product, an insight, or just anything interesting in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset that will be used in this study contains data of approximately 20,000 randomly selected Hacker News posts that received comments. This sampled dataset can be found here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two questions we will be addressing in this project are: \n",
    "1. Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average? \n",
    "2. Do posts created at certain time of the day receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, we want to find out which hours of the day we should make a Hacker News post that will receive the moust amount of  comments. \n",

    "Upon analyzing posts and comments on Hacker News, we found the exact hour of the day in which a post receives the most amount of comments. The dataset we analyzed gave us the hours in the Eastern Time Zone. On average, Hacker News posts tend to receive the most ammount of comments at 3PM ET (7PM Pacific). At 38.59 comments per post, this is the prime time when users are the most active. If we were to set about making a post on Hacker News, 3PM ET seems to be the golden hour that would position our post to be seen by the most amount of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's always nice to find a clear first place when it comes to data analysis. 2AM ET comes at second place at 23.81 average comments per post, which is a significant difference of almost 15 comments. It makes sense that users are the most active around 3PM ET. People are generally active and have the most free time around this time. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a couple things to keep in mind. We worked with a sample dataset that is a representation of the whole data. There is always the chance that the findings may be a little different if we worked with a bigger dataset. In addition, there are other reasons why a post receives a lot of comments other than when it was posted. Content is important and simply posting at 3PM will not guarantee us a lot of comments. In future research, one thing to consider is working with a bigger dataset and finding what kind of topics receive the most amount of comments. \n",

    "In the end, data analysis provided us with important insights on how to receive more comments on Hacker News. "
